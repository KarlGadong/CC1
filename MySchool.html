<h2>Philosophy</h2>
<p class = "marg"> We believe, with Rizal, that the education of the people is
the foundation of a progressive nation. With the framers of the
Constitution, we believe that the right and duty in the rearing of
the youth towards civic efficiency and the development of moral
character rests naturally and primarily on their parents who, in the fulfillment of such
right and duty, shall receive the aid and support of the state and, we might add, of all
sectors of society including ourselves.
We believe that the benefits of higher education should be made accessible to
everyone who deserves it, not only to urban dwellers but especially to the masses
in the countryside.<br><br><br> </sub>For this reason, Baguio Colleges pioneered in higher education
in the Cordilleras in 1946. Baguio since then has become a university town, and a
reasonably high standard of instruction has been made accessible to the youth of
Cordillera and Northern Luzon. To better fulfill its solemn commitments to the youth of
the land, especially those in northern Philippines, Baguio Colleges Foundation blazed
new trails in 1966 by converting into an educational foundation.

We believe that the least that educational institutions must do or the youths
is, in the words of the Constitution, to “inculcate patriotism and nationalism; foster
love of humanity, respect for human rights, appreciation of the role of national
heroes in the historical development of the country; teach the rights and duties of
citizenship; strengthen ethical and spiritual values; develop moral character and
personal discipline, encourage critical and creative thinking; broaden scientific and
technological knowledge, and promote vocational efficiency.”
UC must do more. It shall aim to provide educational opportunities to the maximum
sustainable extent, through high quality teaching, research and publication. Through
personal interaction, students with faculty, students among themselves, students with
the community and the world at large, UC students learn the habits of critical and
creative thinking, shall imbibe the spiritual and cultural
Values and ethics of a nation proud of its past and hopeful of the future, shall
develop the virtues of fairness and tolerance, shall acquire a broader view of issues
and shall strive to maintain their integrity and dignity. They shall acquire the skills,
discipline, and competence necessary for success in technical and professional
endeavors. These are best achieved in an atmosphere of freedom and tolerance,
and a climate of great challenges and greater expectations. While the Filipino youth
shall keep pace with the world-wide advances in human knowledge, UC students
shall spend considerable time and effort towards the attainment of “the national
aspirations for unity, progress and equity,” and, in the process, constitution help
eradicate or, at least, reduce poverty and injustice and other ills of society. </p>


<h2>Vision</h2>

<p class="marg">Into the next half century of service to the youth, we envision UC
as a community of scholars more aggressively involved in the pursuit
and advancement of knowledge in all its dimensions, as an end in
itself and as a tool in personal, community and national development.
UC shall help preserve and develop Filipino culture and values, shall assist in
rearing the Filipino youth to their fullest potentials by training them to think critically
and creatively, to act positively, to contribute to the development of a wholesome
family, community and the larger society.</p>

<p class="marg">UC’s mission is to provide, through the dynamic interaction

the development of skilled professionals who will provide leadership in the various
disciplines, and by the aggressive pursuit of knowledge as an end in itself discovering,
